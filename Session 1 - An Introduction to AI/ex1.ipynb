rarely bares much similarity to the data that the data scientist originally received. One common transformation is to normalize the inputs.  A normalization allows numbers to be put in a standard form so that two values can easily be compared.  Consider if a friend told you that he received a $10 discount.  Is this a good deal?  Maybe.  But the value is not normalized.  If your friend purchased a car, then the discount is not that good.  If your friend purchased dinner, this is a very good discount!\n","\n","Percentages are a very common form of normalization.  If your friend tells you they got 10% off, we know that this is a better discount than 5%.  It does not matter how much the purchase price was.  One very common machine learning normalization is the Z-Score:\n","\n","$z = {x- \\mu \\over \\sigma} $\n","\n","To calculate the Z-Score you need to also calculate the mean($\\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\\sigma$).  The mean is calculated as follows:\n","\n","$\\mu = \\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots +x_n}{n}$\n","\n","The standard deviation is calculated as follows:\n","\n","$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$\n","\n","The following Python code replaces the mpg with a z-score.  Cars with average MPG will be near zero, above zero is above average, and below zero is below average.  Z-Scores above/below -3/3 are very rare, these are outliers."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kU02Jyng0jkj","outputId":"df2fa415-9368-47ca-a198-d572c75a50be"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style
