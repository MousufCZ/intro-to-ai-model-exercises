Both cases result in a model that does not generalize well.\n","\n","This motivates the use of **regularisation** during training in order to reduce the generalization error.

Early stopping\n","\n","Before we look at regularisation, we will pause to look at one commonly used training technique.\n","\n","Training neural networks can be expensive, it terms of time and resource.  In last week's exercises we specified the number of epochs training was to run for, set it running and left it at that.  This might mean leaving the network training once it has converged to a solution.  This will lead to unnecessary training time, and possibly to overfitting.\n","\n","This motivates *early stopping*, where a stopping criteria (in terms of the error) is specified and once this criteria is met, training ceases.\n","\n","In Keras this is specified as a callback, and you might need to set the following parameters:\n","\n","* monitor -- what quantity is being measure, typically *loss*\n","* min_delta -- a change in the monitor less than this value doesn't count as an improvement\n","* patience -- the number of epochs of no improvement to trigger early stopping\n","* mode -- typically *auto*\n","\n","We will now apply this to the auto_mpg example we looked at last week.

The regularization algorithm is attached to the training algorithm by adding an additional objective.  \n","\n","As discussed above, both of these algorithms work by adding a weight penalty to the neural network training.  This penalty encourages the neural network to keep the weights to small values, and L1 and L2 calculate this penalty differently.  For gradient-descent-based algorithms, such as backpropagation, you can add this penalty calculation to the calculated gradients.\n","\n","Both L1 and L2 work differently in the way that they penalize the size of a weight.  L2 will force the weights into a pattern similar to a Gaussian distribution; the L1 will force the weights into a pattern similar to a Laplace distribution, as demonstrated the following:\n","\n","![L1 vs L2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_9_l1_l2.png \"L1 vs L2\")\n","\n","As you can see, L1 algorithm is more tolerant of weights further from 0, whereas the L2 algorithm is less tolerant.  You also need to note that both L1 and L2 count their penalties based only on weights; they do not count penalties on bias values.\n","\n","The code below demonstrates that regularizers can be added to a layer in a neural network (and can be applied to the weight (which is slightly more usual) or to the activation function."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eDg-ArdPRqIN","outputId":"ffea1a86-297b-4a3b-ec88-e832089e5c82"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Epoch 00047: early stopping\n","Final score (RMSE): 3.7053940296173096\n"]}],"source":["from tensorflow.keras import regularizers\n","\n","filename_read = os.path.join(path,\"auto-mpg.csv\")\n","df = pd.read_csv(filename_read,na_values=['NA','?'])\n","\n","df.drop('name',1,inplace=True)\n","missing_median(df, 'horsepower')\n","X,y = to_xy(df,\"mpg\")\n","\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)\n","\n","model = Sequential()\n","model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu',kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l1(0.01)))\n","#model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=x.shape[1], activation='relu',activity_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)))\n","#model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=x.shape[1], activation='relu',\n","#                kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01),\n","#                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(0.01),activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Dense(1))\n","model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n","monitor = EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', min_delta=1e-4, patience=5, verbose=1, mode='auto')\n","model.fit(X_train,y_train,callbacks=[monitor],verbose=0,epochs=1000)\n","pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","# Measure RMSE error.\n","score = np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(pred,y_test))\n","print(\"Final score (RMSE): {}\".format(score))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"it8k45-nRqIO"},"source":["The final version of this code that we shall look at is below.

We might well want to split data into training, validation and testing.  validation_split allows a proportion of the training data to be held back to validation.  It can be interesting to see whether the validation results follow the training results, which would be an indication of a model with good generalisation\n"," - The second is that code has been added to plot training.  Here, epochs is plotted against loss/val_loss.  Notice that the call to fit is now giving a return value, and that represents training information (it's called \"training_trace\" in this example).
